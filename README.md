A summary of this code generated by ChatGPT : 

This Python code provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for downloading YouTube videos and combining their audio and video files into a single video file. The program uses various modules such as os, subprocess, tkinter, filedialog, messagebox, and pytube to accomplish the tasks.

The key components of the code are:

    1.The user is prompted to enter a YouTube video link and select a download directory.
    2.The program then downloads the audio and video streams of the YouTube video in the desired formats     (1080p video in mp4 format and 160kbps audio in webm format).
    3.The downloaded audio and video files are stored in separate directories.
    4.The program uses FFmpeg to combine the audio and video files into a final output video file with the  same title as the original YouTube video.
    5.After the combination process, the individual audio and video files are deleted, and only the output video stays in the specified download directory.

The code consists of following functions:

    1.getDirectory(): Asks the user to select the directory where the video will be downloaded.

    2.getTitle(): Modifies the YouTube video title to replace invalid characters with underscores, making it a valid filename.

    3.downloadVideo(): Downloads the YouTube video and audio streams separately using the pytube library. It then calls the combineFiles() function to merge the video and audio streams.

    4.combineFiles(mp4_file, webm_file, output_file): Combines the downloaded video and audio files into a final video with sound using FFmpeg. It removes the individual video and audio files after the combination.

The graphical interface includes a window where the user can enter the YouTube link and select a download directory. There are buttons to browse for the directory and start the download process. If any error occurs during the download or combination process, a popup error message is displayed.

Please note that the code uses the pytube library to download YouTube videos and requires FFmpeg to be installed on the system for video and audio combination. Additionally, the code handles exceptions, ensuring error-free execution and providing a smoother user experience.
